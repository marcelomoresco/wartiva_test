## Popup Positioning in Multiline TextFormField

This document explains why one implementation of a popup overlay works correctly in a multiline TextFormField, while another does not. The issue revolves around the dynamic positioning of the popup relative to the cursor in a multiline text field.

This fixed version ensures that the suggestions always appear directly below the cursor, no matter how many lines the text spans.

### Dynamic Positioning with CompositedTransformFollower:

The CompositedTransformFollower widget is used to link the overlay to the TextFormField. This ensures that the overlay follows the text field even when its size or position changes.

The offset is calculated based on the cursor's position (caretOffset.dx) and the height of the text field (textFieldHeight).

```
offset: Offset(textFieldOffset.dx + caretOffset.dx, textFieldHeight + 16),
```

#### Why Use CompositedTransformFollower?

CompositedTransformFollower allows us to position the overlay relative to a widget, even if the widget moves, scrolls, or resizes â€” which is perfect for things like autocomplete popups.

### Accurate Cursor Position Calculation:

The \_getCaretPosition function calculates the cursor's position using TextPainter. It includes both the horizontal (caretPosition.dx) and vertical (caretPosition.dy) positions, as well as the line height (caretHeight).

This ensures the popup is positioned correctly, even in multiline text fields.
